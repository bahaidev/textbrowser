And it can scarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second, and fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period as given by N&#34;ldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it therefore, in N&#34;ldeke, opinion, immediately precedes. But this may be accounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and public devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of the Muhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice.  It should also be observed that, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same number of petitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer. It is recited several times in each of the five daily prayers, and on many other occassions, as in concluding a bargain, etc. It is termed &quot;the Opening of the Book,&quot; &quot;the Completion,&quot; &quot;the Sufficing Sura,&quot; the Sura of Praise, Thanks, and Prayer,&quot; &quot;the Healer,&quot; &quot;the Remedy,&quot; &quot;the Basis,&quot; &quot;the Treasure,&quot; &quot;the Mother of the Book,&quot; &quot;the Seven Verses of Repetition.&quot; The Muhammadans always say &quot;Amen&quot; after this prayer, Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so by the Angel Gabriel."],["4","8","0","1","ENTITLED, THE PREFACE, OR INTRODUCTION;a REVEALED AT MECCA.","a  In Arabic al Fâtihat.

The earth he had taken was carried into Arabia, to a place between Mecca and Tayef, where, being first kneaded by the angels, it was afterwards fashioned by God himself into a human form, and left to dry6 for the space of forty days, or, as others say, as many years, the angels in the meantime often visiting it, and Eblis (then one of the angels who are nearest to God&#39;s presence, afterwards the devil) among the rest; but he, not contented with looking on it, kicked it with his foot till it rung and knowing God designed that creature to be his superior, took a secret resolution never to acknowledge him as such.  After this, God animated the figure of clay and endued it with an intelligent soul, and when he had placed him in paradise, formed Eve out of his left side.7<br \/><br \/>5  Al Termedi, from a tradition of Abu Musa al Ashari<br \/>6  Kor. c. 55.<br \/>7  Khondamir.

It is true, some of their doctors do agree this to be the purport of the words;1 but then they say the latitude hereby granted was soon revoked, for that this passage is abrogated by several others in the Korân, which expressly declare that none can be saved who is not of the Mohammedan faith, and particularly by those words of the third chapter, Whoever followeth any other religion than Islâm (i.e., the Mohammedan) it shall not be accepted of him, and at the last day he shall be of those who perish.2  However, others are of opinion that this passage is not abrogated, but interpret it differently, taking the meaning of it to be that no man, whether he be a Jew, a Christian, or a Sabian, shall be excluded from salvation, provided he quit his erroneous religion and become a Moslem, which they say is intended by the following words, Whoever believeth in GOD and the last day, and doth that which is right.  And this interpretation is approved by Mr. Reland, who thinks the words here import no more than those of the apostle, In every nation he that feareth GOD, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him;3 from which it must not be inferred that the religion of nature, or any other, is sufficient to save, without faith in Christ.4<br \/><br \/>7  Selden, de Jure Nat. et Gent. sec.

The other part of the inhabitants, who strictly observed the sabbath, used both persuasion and force to stop this impiety, but to no purpose, the offenders growing only more and more obstinate; whereupon David cursed the sabbath-breakers, and God transformed them into apes.  It is said that one going to see a friend of his that was among them, found him in the shape of an ape, moving his eyes about wildly; and asking him whether he was not such a one, the ape made a sign with his head that it was he; whereupon the friend said to him, Did not I advise you to desist? at which the ape wept.

Moses answered, He saith, She is neither an old cow, nor a young heifer, but of a middle age between both: do ye therefore that which ye are commanded.","b  The occasion of this sacrifice is thus related.  A certain man at his death left his son, then a child, a cow-calf, which wandered in the desert till he came to age; at which time his mother told him the heifer was his, and bid him fetch her, and sell her for three pieces of gold.  When the young man came to the market with his heifer, an angel in the shape of a man accosted him, and bid him six pieces of gold for her; but he would not take the money till he had asked his mother&#39;s consent; which when he had obtained, he returned to the market-place, and met the angel, who now offered him twice as much for the heifer, provided he would say nothing of it to his mother; but the young man refusing, went and acquainted her with the additional offer.  The woman perceiving it was an angel, bid her son go back and ask him what must be done with the heifer; whereupon the angel told the young man that in a little time the children of Israel would buy that heifer of him at any price.  And soon after it happened that an Israelite, named Hammiel, was killed by a relation of his, who, to prevent discovery, conveyed the body to a place considerably distant from that where the fact was committed.  The friends of the slain man accused some other persons of the murder before Moses; but they denying the fact, and there being no evidence to convict them, God commanded a cow, of such and such particular marks, to be killed; but there being no other which answered the description except the orphan&#39;s heifer, they were obliged to buy her for as much gold as her hide would hold; according to some, for her full weight in gold, and as others say, for ten times as much.  This heifer they sacrificed, and the dead body being, by divine direction, struck with a part of it, revived, and standing up, named the person who had killed him; after which it immediately fell down dead again.1  The whole story seems to be borrowed from the red heifer, which was ordered by the Jewish law to be burnt, and the ashes kept for purifying those who happened to touch a dead corpse;2 and from the heifer directed to be slain for the expiation of an uncertain murder.

Mohammed&#39;s forces consisted of no more than three hundred and nineteen men, but the enemy&#39;s army of near a thousand, notwithstanding which odds he put them to flight, having killed seventy of the principal Koreish, and taken as many prisoners, with the loss of only fourteen of his own men.1  This was the first victory obtained by the prophet, and though it may seem no very considerable action, yet it was of great advantage to him, and the foundation of all his future power and success.  For which reason it is famous in the Arabian history, and more than once vaunted in the Korân,2 as an effect of the divine assistance.  The miracle, it is said, consisted in three things:  1. Mohammed, by the direction of the angel Gabriel, took a handful of gravel and threw it toward the enemy in the attack, saying, May their faces be confounded; whereupon they immediately turned their backs and fled.  But though the prophet seemingly threw the gravel himself, yet it is told in the Korân,3 that it was not he, but God, who threw it, that is to say, by the ministry of his angel.  2.  The Mohammedan troops seemed to the infidels to be twice as many in number as themselves, which greatly discouraged them.  And 3.  God sent down to their assistance first a thousand and afterwards three thousand angels, led by Gabriel, mounted on his horse Haizûm; and, according to the Korân,4 these celestial auxiliaries really did all the execution, though Mohammed&#39;s men imagined themselves did it, and fought stoutly at the same time.<br \/><br \/>1  Elmacin. p. 5.

Whereupon the criminals were stoned, to the great mortification of the Jews.<br \/> It is very remarkable that this law of Moses concerning the stoning of adulterers is mentioned in the New Testament2 (though I know some dispute the authenticity of that whole passage), but is not now to be found, either in the Hebrew or Samaritan Pentateuch, or in the Septuagint; it being only said that such shall be put to death.3  This omission is insisted on by the Mohammedans as one instance of the corruption of the law of Moses by the Jews.<br \/> It is also observable that there was a verse once extant in the Korân, commanding adulterers to be stoned; and the commentators say the words only are abrogated, the sense or law still remaining in force.4<br \/><br \/>2  John viii. 5.<br \/>3  Levit. xx. 10.

One was the father of Moses and Aaron; and the other was the father of the Virgin Mary;2 but he is called by some Christian writers Joachim.  The commentators suppose the first, or rather both of them, to be meant in this place; however, the person intended in the next passage, it is agreed, was the latter; who besides Mary the mother of Jesus, had also a son named Aaron,3 and another sister, named Ishá (or Elizabeth), who married Zacharias, and was the mother of John the Baptist; whence that prophet and Jesus are usually called by the Mohammedans, The two sons of the aunt, or the cousins german.<br \/> From the identity of names it has been generally imagined by Christian writers4 that the Korân here confounds Mary the mother of Jesus, with Mary or Miriam the sister of Moses and Aaron; which intolerable anachronism, if it were certain, is sufficient of itself to destroy the pretended authority of this book.  But though Mohammed may be supposed to have been ignorant enough in ancient history and chronology to have committed so gross a blunder, yet I do not see how it can be made out from the words of the Korân.  For it does not follow, because two persons have the same name, and have each a father and brother who bear the same names, that they must therefore necessarily be the same person: besides, such a mistake is inconsistent with a number of other places in the Korân, whereby it manifestly appears that Mohammed well knew and asserted that Moses preceded Jesus several ages.  And the commentators accordingly fail not to tell us that there had passed about one thousand eight hundred years between Amrân the father of Moses, and Amrân the father of the Virgin Mary: they also make them the sons of different persons; the first, they say, was the son of Yeshar, or Izhar (though he was really his brother),5 the son of Kâhath, the son of Levi; and the other was the son of Mathân,6 whose genealogy they trace, but in a very corrupt and imperfect manner, up to David, and thence to Adam.7<br \/> It must be observed that though the Virgin Mary is called in the Korân1 the sister of Aaron, yet she is nowhere called the sister of Moses; however, some Mohammedan writers have imagined that the same individual Mary, the sister of Moses, was miraculously preserved alive from his time till that of Jesus Christ, purposely to become the mother of the latter.2<br \/><br \/>2  Al Zamakhshari, al Beidâwi.<br \/>3  Kor. c. 19.<br \/>4  Vide Reland. de Rel.

For it is the constant doctrine of the Mohammedans that it was not Jesus himself who underwent that ignominious death, but somebody else in his shape and resemblance.4  The person crucified some will have to be a spy that was sent to entrap him; others, that it was one Titian, who by the direction of Judas entered in at a window of the house where Jesus was, to kill him; and others that it was Judas himself, who agreed with the rulers of the Jews to betray him for thirty pieces of silver, and led those who were sent to take him.<br \/> They add, that Jesus after his crucifixion in effigy, was sent down again to the earth, to comfort his mother and disciples and acquaint them how the Jews were deceived; and was then taken up a second time into heaven.5<br \/> It is supposed by several that this story was an original invention of Mohammed&#39;s; but they are certainly mistaken; for several sectaries held the same opinion, long before his time.  The Basilidians,6 in the very beginning of Christianity, denied that Christ himself suffered, but that Simon the Cyrenean was crucified in his place.  The Cerinthians before them, and the Carpocratians next (to name no more of those who affirmed Jesus to have been a mere man), did believe the same thing; that it was not himself, but one of his followers very like him that was crucified.  Photius tells us, that he read a book entitled, &#34;The Journeys of the Apostles,&#34; relating the acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas and Paul; and among other things contained therein, this was one, that Christ, was not crucified, but another in his stead, and that therefore he laughed at his crucifiers,7 or those who thought they had crucified him.8<br \/> I have in another place9 mentioned an apocryphal gospel of Barnabas, a forgery originally of some nominal Christians, but interpolated since by Mohammedans; which gives this part of the history of Jesus with circumstances too curious to be omitted.  It is therein related, that the moment the Jews were going to apprehend Jesus in the garden, he was snatched up into the third heaven by the ministry of four angels, Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and Uriel; that he will not die till the end of the world, and that it was Judas who was crucified in his stead; God having permitted that traitor to appear so like his master, in the eyes of the Jews, that they took and delivered him to Pilate.  That this resemblance was so great, that it deceived the Virgin Mary and the Apostles themselves; but that Jesus Christ afterward obtained leave of God to go and comfort them.  That Barnabas having then asked him, why the divine goodness had suffered the mother and disciples of so holy a prophet to believe even for one moment that he had died in so ignominious a manner?  Jesus returned the following answer.  &#34;O Barnabas, believe me that every sin, how small soever, is punished by God with great torment, because God is offended with sin.  My mother therefore and faithful disciples, having loved me with a mixture of earthly love, the just God has been pleased to punish this love with their present grief, that they might not be punished for it hereafter in the flames of hell.  And as for me, though I have myself been blameless in the world, yet other men having called me God and the Son of God; therefore God, that I might not be mocked by the devils at the day of judgment, has been pleased that in this world I should be mocked by men with the death of Judas, making everybody believe that I died upon the cross.  And hence it is that this mocking is still to continue till the coming of Mohammed, the messenger of God; who, coming into the world, will undeceive every one who shall believe in the law of God from this mistake.1<br \/><br \/>4  See Kor. c. 4.<br \/>5  Vide Marracc. in Alc. p. 113, &amp;c., et in Prodr. part iii. p. 63, &amp;c.<br \/>5  Irenæus, l.

But others acknowledge that he actually died a natural death, and continued in that state three hours, or, according to another tradition, seven hours; after which he was restored to life, and then taken up to heaven.3<br \/><br \/>2  See the Prelim.

The Koreish, to revenge their loss at Bedr,1 the next year being the third of the Hejra, got together an army of 3,000 men, among whom there were 200 horse, and 700 armed with coats of mail.  These forces marched under the conduct of Abu Sofiân and sat down at Dhu&#39;lholeifa, a village about six miles from Medina.  Mohammed, being much inferior to his enemies in numbers, at first determined to keep himself within the town, and receive them there; but afterwards, the advice of some of his companions prevailing, he marched out against them at the head of 1,000 men (some say he had 1,050 men, others but 900), of whom 100 were armed with coats of mail, but he had no more than one horse, besides his own, in his whole army.  With these forces he formed a camp in a village near Ohod, which mountain he contrived to have on his back; and the better to secure his men from being surrounded, he placed fifty archers in the rear, with strict orders not to quit their post.  When they came to engage, Mohammed had the better at first, but afterwards by the fault of his archers, who left their ranks for the sake of the plunder, and suffered the enemies&#39; horse to encompass the Mohammedans and attack them in the rear, he lost the day, and was very near losing his life, being struck down by a shower of stones, and wounded in the face with two arrows, on pulling out of which his two foreteeth dropped out.  Of the Moslems seventy men were slain, and among them Hamza the uncle of Mohammed, and of the infidels twenty-two.2  To excuse the ill success of this battle, and to raise the drooping courage of his followers, is Mohammed&#39;s drift in the remaining part of this chapter.<br \/><br \/>1  See before, p. 32.<br \/>2  Abulfeda, in Vita Moham. p. 64, &amp;c.

But at length they agreed to refer the matter to the prophet singly, who, giving it in favor of the Jew, the Mohammedan refused to acquiesce in his sentence, but would needs have it re-heard by Omar, afterwards Khalif.  When they came to him, the Jew told him that Mohammed had already decided the affair in his favour, but that the other would not submit to his determination; and the Mohammedan confessing this to be true, Omar bid them stay a little, and fetching his sword, struck off the obstinate Moslem&#39;s head, saying aloud, This is the reward of him who refuseth to submit to the judgment of God and his apostle.

Banu Honeifa, who followed the famous false prophet Moseilama.4  3.  Banu Asad, who acknowledged Toleiha Ebn Khowailed, another Banu Asad, who acknowledged Toleiha Ebn Khowailed, another pretender to divine revelation,5 for their prophet.  All these fell off in Mohammed&#39;s lifetime.  The following, except only the last, apostatized in the reign of Abu Becr.  4.  Certain of the tribe of Fezârah, headed by Oyeyma Ebn Hosein.  5.  Some of the tribe of Ghatfân, whose leader was Korrah Ebn Salma.  6.  Banu Soleim, who followed al Fajâah Ebn Ad Yalîl.  7.  Banu Yarbu, whose captain was Malec Ebn Noweirah Ebn Kais.  8.  Part of the tribe of Tamîm, the proselytes of Sajâj the daughter of al Mondhar, who gave herself out for a prophetess.6  9.  The tribe of Kendah, led by al Asháth Ebn Kais.  10.  Banu Becr Ebn al Wayel, in the province of Bahrein, headed by al Hotam Ebn Zeid.  And, 11.  Some of the tribe of Ghassân, who with their prince Jabalah Ebn al Ayham, renounced Mohammedism in the time of Omar, and returned to their former profession of Christianity.7<br \/> But as to the persons who fulfilled the other part of this prophecy, by supplying the loss of so many renegades, the commentators are not agreed.  Some will have them to be the inhabitants of Yaman, and others the Persians; the authority of Mohammed himself being vouched for both opinions.  Others, however, suppose them to be 2,000 of the tribe of al Nakhá (who dwelt in Yaman), 5,000 of those of Kendah and Bajîlah, and 3,000 of unknown descent,8 who were present at the famous battle of Kadesia, fought in the Khalîfat of Omar, and which put an end to the Persian empire.9<br \/><br \/>3  See the Prelim.

Upon this they went again before Mohammed, to whom these words, And if it appear, &amp;c., were revealed; and thereupon Amru Ebn al As and al Motalleb Ebn Abi Refâa, both of the tribe of Sahm, stood up, and were sworn against them; and judgment was given accordingly.1<br \/><br \/>1  Al Beidâwi.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Thus will it be easier for men to bear a true39 witness, or fear lest after their oath another oath be given.

Jesus having, at the request of his followers, asked it of God, a red table immediately descended, in their sight, between two clouds, and was set before them; whereupon he rose up, and having made the ablution, prayed, and then took off the cloth which covered the table, saying, In the name of GOD, the best provider of food.  What the provisions were with which this table was furnished is a matter wherein the expositors are not agreed.  One will have them to be nine cakes of bread and nine fishes; another bread and flesh; another, all sorts of food, except flesh; another all sorts of food, except bread and flesh; another, all except bread and fish; another, one fish, which had the taste of all manner of food; and another, fruits of paradise; but the most received tradition is that when the table was uncovered, there appeared a fish ready dressed, without scales or prickly fins, dropping with fat, having salt placed at its head and vinegar at its tail, and round it all sorts of herbs, except leeks, and five loaves of bread, on one of which there were olives, on the second honey, on the third butter, on the fourth cheese, and on the fifth dried flesh.  They add that Jesus, at the request of the apostles, showed them another miracle, by restoring the fish to life, and causing its scales and fins to return to it, at which the standers-by being affrighted, he caused it to become as it was before; that 1,300 men and women, all afflicted with bodily infirmities or poverty, ate of these provisions, and were satisfied, the fish remaining whole as it was at first; that then the table flew up to heaven in the sight of all; and every one who had partaken of this food were delivered from their infirmities and misfortunes; and that it continued to descend for forty days together at dinner-time, and stood on the ground till the sun declined, and was then taken up into the clouds.  Some of the Mohammedan writers are of opinion that this table did not really descend, but that it was only a parable; but most think the words of the Korân are plain to the contrary.  A further tradition is, that several men were changed into swine for disbelieving this miracle, and attributing it to magic art; or, as others pretend, for stealing some of the victuals from off it.1  Several other fabulous circumstances are also told, which are scarce worth transcribing.2<br \/><br \/>Idem, al Thalabi.<br \/>2  Vide Marracc. in Alc. p. 238, &amp;c.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Remember when the Apostles42 said&ndash;&quot;O Jesus, Son of Mary! is thy Lord able to send down a furnished TABLE to us out of Heaven?&quot; He said&ndash;&quot;Fear God if ye be believers.&quot;","42 Ar.

However, some of their writers pretend that Azer was the son of Terah,1 and D&#39;Herbelot says that the Arabs always distinguish them in their genealogies as different persons; but that because Abraham was the son of Terah according to Moses, it is therefore supposed (by European writers) that Terah is the same with the Azer of the Arabs.2  How true this observation may be in relation to some authors, I cannot say, but I am sure it cannot be true of all; for several Arab and Turkish writers expressly make Azer and Terah the same person.3  Azer, in ancient times, was the name of the planet Mars, and the month of March was so called by the most ancient Persians; for the word originally signifying fire (as it still does,) it was therefore given by them and the Chaldeans to that planet,4 which partaking, as was supposed, of a fiery nature, was acknowledged by the Chaldeans and Assyrians as a god or planetary deity, whom in old times they worshipped under the form of a pillar: whence Azer became a name among the nobility, who esteemed it honourable to be denominated from their gods,5 and is found in the composition of several Babylonish names.  For these reasons a learned author supposes Azer to have been the heathen name of Terah, and that the other was given him on his conversion.6  Al Beidâwi confirms this conjecture, saying that Azer was the name of the idol which he worshipped.  It may be observed that Abraham&#39;s father is also called Zarah in the Talmud and Athar by Eusebius.<br \/><br \/>1  Tarîkh Montakhab, apud D&#39;Herbel. Bibl. Orient. p. 12.<br \/>2  D&#39;Herbel. ibid.<br \/>3  Al Beidâwi, Jallalo&#39;ddin, Yahya, Ebn Shohnah, Mirat Kainat, &amp;c.  Vide etiam Pharhang Jehang-hiri, apud Hyde de Rel. Vet.

Some of the Rabbins say Terah was a priest, and chief of the order.12<br \/><br \/>7  Josh. xxiv. 2, 14.<br \/>8  Epiphan. adv.

Verily, I see that thou and thy people are in manifest error.","18 Azar. This form is probably borrowed from Athar, as Terah is called by Eusebius. See Maracci Prodr. iv. 90. Compare a similar narrative (Midr. Rabbah on Gen. par. 17) in which Abraham is given over by his idolatrous father Zarah to Nimrod, who says, &quot;We will adore the Fire:&quot; &quot;Rather,&quot; said Abraham, &quot;the water which puts out fire.&quot; &quot;The Water then&quot;&ndash;&quot;Rather the clouds that bear the water.&quot; &quot;The Clouds then&quot;&ndash;&quot;Rather the wind which scatters the clouds.&quot; &quot;The Wind then&quot;&ndash;&quot;Rather man who endures the wind.&quot; Whereupon Abraham was thrown into the furnace. It is quite possible that in what follows, Muhammad may have intended to imply that Abraham had renounced the Sabian starworship of his fathers, and to vindicate him from the habit of consulting the stars attributed to him by the Talmudists.

Gen. xv. 5."],["891","89","76","6","And when the night overshadowed him, he saw a star, and he said, This is my LORD;o but when it set, he said, I like not gods which set.","o  Since Abraham&#39;s parents were idolaters, it seems to be a necessary consequence that himself was one also in his younger years; the scripture not obscurely intimates as much,1 and the Jews themselves acknowledge it.2  At what age he came to the knowledge of the true God and left idolatry, opinions are various.  Some Jewish writers tell us he was then but three years old,3 and the Mohammedans likewise suppose him very young, and that he asked his father and mother several shrewd questions when a child.4  Others, however, allow him to have been a middle-aged man at that time.5  Maimonides, in particular, and R. Abraham Zacuth think him to have been forty years old, which age is also mentioned in the Korân.  But the general opinion of the Mohammedans is that he was about fifteen or sixteen.6  As the religion wherein Abraham was educated was the Sabian, which consisted chiefly in the worship of the heavenly bodies,7 he is introduced examining their nature and properties, to see whether they had a right to the worship which was paid them or not; and the first which he observed was the planet Venus, or, as others will have it, Jupiter.8  This method of Abraham&#39;s attaining to the knowledge of the supreme Creator of all things, is conformable to what Josephus writes, viz.: That he drew his notions from the changes which he had observed in the earth and the sea, and in the sun and the moon, and the rest of the celestial bodies; concluding that they were subject to the command of a superior power, to whom alone all honour and thanks are due.9  The story itself is certainly taken from the Talmud.10  Some of the commentators, however, suppose this reasoning of Abraham with himself was not the first means of his conversion, but that he used it only by way of argument to convince the idolaters among whom he then lived.<br \/><br \/>1  Vide Josh. xxiv. 2, 14, and Hyde, ubi sup. p. 59.<br \/>2  Joseph.

Mecca was then in the hands of the tribe of Amalek whose prince was Moâwiyah Ebn Becr; and he, being without the city when the ambassadors arrived, entertained them there for a month in so hospitable a manner that they had forgotten the business they came about had not the king reminded them of it, not as from himself, lest they should think he wanted to be rid of them, but by some verses which he put into the mouth of a singing woman.  At which, being roused from their lethargy, Morthed told them the only way they had to obtain what they wanted would be to repent and obey their prophet; but this displeasing the rest, they desired Moâwiyah to imprison him, lest he should go with them; which being done, Kail with the rest entering Mecca, begged of GOD that he would send rain to the people of Ad.  Whereupon three clouds appeared, a white one, a red one, and a black one; and a voice from heaven ordered Kail to choose which he would.  Kail failed not to make choice of the last, thinking it to be laden with the most rain; but when this cloud came over them, it proved to be fraught with the divine vengeance, and a tempest broke forth from it which destroyed them all.3<br \/><br \/>1  Prelim.

She, being unable to give an answer to this question, went in a fright to Adam, and acquainted him with the matter, who, not knowing what to think of it, grew sad and pensive.  Whereupon the devil appeared to her again (or, as others say, to Adam), and pretended that he by his prayers would obtain of GOD that she might be safely delivered of a son in Adam&#39;s likeness, provided they would promise to name him Abda&#39;lhareth, or the servant of al Hareth (which was the devil&#39;s name among the angels), instead of Abd&#39;allah, or the servant of GOD, as Adam had designed.  This proposal was agreed to, and accordingly, when the child was born, they gave it that name, upon which it immediately died.1  And with this Adam and Eve are here taxed, as an act of idolatry.

Abu Sofiân, who commanded the little convoy, having notice of Mohammed&#39;s motions, sent to Mecca for succours; upon which Abu Jahl, and all the principal men of the city, except only <br \/>Abu Laheb, marched to his assistance, with a body of nine hundred and fifty men.  Mohammed had no sooner received advice of this, than Gabriel descended with a promise that he should either take the caravan or beat the succours; whereupon he consulted with his companions which of the two he should attack.  Some of them were for setting upon the caravan, saying that they were not prepared to fight such a body of troops as were coming with Abu Jahl: but this proposal Mohammed rejected, telling them that the caravan was at a considerable distance by the seaside, whereas Abu Jahl was just upon them.  The others, however, insisted so obstinately on pursuing the first design of falling on the caravan, that the prophet grew angry, but by the interposition of Abu Becr, Omar, Saad Ebn Obadah, and Mokdâd Ebn Amru, they at length acquiesced in his opinion.  Mokdâd in particular assured him they were all ready to obey his orders, and would not say to him, as the children of Israel did to Moses, Go thou and thy LORD to fight, for we will sit here;1 but, Go thou and thy LORD to fight, and we will fight with you.  At this Mohammed smiled, and again sat down to consult with them, applying himself chiefly to the Ansârs or helpers, because they were the greater part of his forces, and he had some apprehension lest they should not think themselves obliged by the oath they had taken to him at al Akaba,2 to assist him against any other than such as should attack him in Medina.  But Saad Ebn Moâdh, in the name of the rest, told him that they had received him as the apostle of GOD, and had promised him obedience, and were therefore all to a man ready to follow him where he pleased, though it were into the sea.

Mohammed did not approve of the latter advice, but observed that Abu Becr resembled Abraham, who interceded for offenders, and that Omar was like Noah, who prayed for the utter extirpation of the wicked antediluvians; and thereupon it was agreed to accept a ransom from them and their fellow-captives.  Soon after which, Omar, going into the prophet&#39;s tent, found him and Abu Becr weeping, and, asking them the reason of their tears, Mohammed acquainted him that this verse had been revealed, condemning their ill-timed lenity towards their prisoners, and that they had narrowly escaped the divine vengeance for it, adding that, if GOD had not passed the matter over, they had certainly been destroyed to a man, excepting only Omar and Saad Ebn Moadh, a person of as great severity, and who was also for putting the prisoners to death.1  Yet did not this crime go absolutely unpunished neither: for in the battle of Ohod the Moslems lost seventy men, equal to the number of prisoners taken at Bedr, 2 which was so ordered by GOD, as a retaliation or atonement for the same.<br \/><br \/>1  Idem.<br \/>2  See c. 3, p. 46.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Had there not been a previous ordinance20 from God, a severe chastisement had befallen you, for the ransom which ye took.","20 Authorising the ransom of captives."],["1265","95","70","8","Eat therefore of what ye have acquired,a that which is lawful and good; for GOD is gracious and merciful.","a  i.e., Of the ransom which ye have received of your prisoners.

Whereupon Mohammed asked him what was become of the gold which he delivered to Omm al Fadl when he left Mecca, telling her that he knew not what might befall him in the expedition, and therefore, if he lost his life, she might keep it herself for the use of her and her children?  Al Abbâs demanded who told him this, to which Mohammed replied that GOD had revealed it to him.  And upon this al Abbâs immediately professed Islâmism, declaring that none could know of that affair except GOD, because he gave her the money at midnight.

It is said that Omar at first refused to accept tribute from a Magian, till Abd&#39;alrahmân Ebn Awf assured him that Mohammed himself had granted protection to a Magian, and ordered that the professors of that religion should be included among the people of the book, or those who found their religion on some book which they suppose to be of divine original.

Abu Hanîfa supposed people of any religion might be suffered, except the idolatrous Arabs; and Malec excepted only apostates from Mohammedism.<br \/> The least tribute that can be taken from every such person, is generally agreed to be a dinâr or about ten shillings, a year; nor can he be obliged to pay more unless he consent to it; and this, they say, ought to be laid as well on the poor as on the rich.1  But Abu Hanîfa decided that the rich should pay forty-eight dirhems (twenty, and sometimes twenty-five, of which made a dinâr) a year; one in middling circumstances half that sum; and a poor man, who was able to get his living, a quarter of it: but that he who was not able to support himself should pay nothing.2<br \/><br \/>6  Vide al Beidâwi.<br \/>1  Vide Reland. de Jure Militari Mohammedanor. p. 17 and 50.<br \/>2  Al Beidâwi.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Make war upon such of those to whom the Scriptures have been given as believe not in God, or in the last day, and who forbid not that which God and His Apostle have forbidden, and who profess not the profession of the truth, until they pay tribute out of hand,10 and they be humbled.11","10 Or, by right of subjection, Sale; in cash, Wahl.; all without exception, K. i.e. as if by counting hands.<br \/><br \/>11 Thus Hilchoth Melachim, vi. 4.

It is not improbable, however, that the fiction came originally from the Jews, though they be now of another opinion, and I cannot fix it upon them by any direct proof.  For, not to insist on the testimony of the Mohammedans (which yet I cannot but think of some little weight in a point of this nature), it is allowed by the most sagacious critics that the second book of Ezra was written by a Christian indeed,9 but yet one who had been bred a Jew, and was intimately acquainted with the fables of the Rabbins;10 and the story itself is perfectly in the taste and way of thinking of those men.<br \/><br \/>3  See cap. 2, p. 28.<br \/>4  Al Beidâwi, al Zamakhshari, &amp;c.<br \/>5  Connect. part i. l. 5, p. 329.<br \/>6  Athanasius junior, in Synopsi S.

They likewise tell us that Noah was two years in building the ark, which was framed of Indian plane-tree,16 that it was divided into three stories, of which the lower was designed for the beasts, the middle one for the men and women, and the upper for the birds;17 and that the men were separated from the women by the body of Adam, which Noah had taken into the ark.18  This last is a tradition of the eastern Christians,19 some of whom pretend that the matrimonial duty was superseded and suspended during the time Noah and his family were in the ark;20 though Ham has been accused of not observing continency on that occasion, his wife, it seems, bringing forth Caanan in the very ark.21<br \/><br \/>12  Al Beidâwi, &amp;c.<br \/>13  Idem, &amp;c.<br \/>14  Yahya.

The relics of the ark were also to be seen here in the time of Epiphanius, if we may believe him;9 and we are told the emperor Heraclius went from the town of Thamanin up to the mountain al Jûdi, and saw the place of the ark.10  There was also formerly a famous monastery, called the monastery of the ark, upon some of these mountains, where the Nestorians used to celebrate a feast day on the spot where they supposed the ark rested; but in the year of Christ 776, that monastery was destroyed by lightning, with the church, and a numerous congregation in it.11  Since which time it seems the credit of this tradition hath declined, and given place to another, which obtains at present, and according to which the ark rested on Mount Masis, in Armenia, called by the Turks Aghir dagh, or the heavy or great mountain, and situate about twelve leagues south-east of Erivan.12<br \/><br \/>1  See Bochart.

The commentators tell us that, when the sons of Jacob had gotten Joseph with them in the field, they began to abuse and to beat him so unmercifully, that they had killed him, had not Judah, on his crying out for help, insisted on the promise they had made not to kill him, but to cast him into the well.  Whereupon they let him down a little way; but, as he held by the sides of the well, they bound him, and took off his inner garment, designing to stain it with blood, to deceive their father.  Joseph begged hard to have his garment returned him, but to no purpose, his brothers telling him, with a sneer, that the eleven stars and the sun and the moon might clothe him and keep him company.  When they had let him down half-way, they let him fall thence to the bottom, and, there being water in the well (though the scripture says the contrary), he was obliged to get upon a stone, on which, as he stood weeping, the angel Gabriel came to him with the revelation mentioned immediately.1<br \/><br \/>1  Idem.<br \/><br \/>y  Joseph being then but seventeen years old, al Beidâwi observes that herein he resembled John the Baptist and Jesus, who were also favoured with the divine communication very early.

The tongue of the person unto whom they incline is a foreign tongue; but this, wherein the Koran is written, is the perspicuous Arabic tongue.a","a  This was a great objection made by the Meccans to the authority of the Korân; for when Mohammed insisted, as a proof of its divine original, that it was impossible a man so utterly unacquainted with learning as himself could compose such a book, they replied, that he had one or more assistants in the forgery; but as to the particular person or persons suspected of this confederacy, the traditions differ.  One says it was Jabar, a Greek, servant to Amer Ebn al Hadrami, who could read and write well;3 another, that they were Jabar and Yesâr, two slaves who followed the trade of sword-cutlers at Mecca, and used to read the pentateuch and gospel, and had often Mohammed for their auditor, when he passed that way.4  Another tells us, it was one Aïsh, or Yâïsh, a domestic of al Haweiteb Ebn Abd al Uzza, who was a man of some learning, and had embraced Mohammedism.5  Another supposes it was one Kais, a Christian, whose house Mohammed frequented;6 another, that it was Addâs, a servant of Otba Ebn Rabîa;7 and another, that it was Salmân the Persian.8<br \/> According to some Christian writers,9 Abdallah Ebn Salâm, the Jew who was so intimate with Mohammed (named by one, according to the Hebrew dialect, Abdias Ben Salon and by another, Abdala Celen), was assisting to him in the compiling his pretended revelations.  This Jew Dr. Prideaux confounds with Salmân the Persian, who was a very different man, as a late author10 has observed before me; wherefore, and for that we may have occasion to speak of Salmân hereafter, it may be proper to add a brief extract of his story as told by himself.  He was of a good family of Ispahan, and, in his younger years, left the religion of his country to embrace Christianity; and travelling into Syria, was advised by a certain monk of Amuria to go into Arabia, where a prophet was expected to arise about that time, who should establish the religion of Abraham; and whom he should know, among other things, by the seal of prophecy between his shoulders.  Salmân performed the journey, and meeting with Mohammed at Koba, where he rested in his flight to Medina, soon found him to be the person he sought, and professed Islâm.11<br \/> The general opinion of the Christians, however is, that the chief help Mohammed had in the contriving his Korân, was from a Nestorian monk named Sergius, supposed to be the same person with the monk Boheira, with whom Mohammed in his younger years had some conference, at Bosra, a city of Syria Damascena, where that monk resided.12  To confirm which supposition, a passage has been produced from an Arab writer,1 who says that Boheira&#39;s name in the books of the Christians, is Sergius; but this is only a conjecture; and another2 tells us, his true name was Saïd, or Felix, and his surname Boheira.  But be that as it will, if Boheira and Sergius were the same man, I find not the least intimation in the Mohammedan writers that he ever quitted his monastery to go into Arabia (as is supposed by the Christians); and his acquaintance with Mohammed at Bosra was too early to favour the surmise of his assisting him in the Korân, which was composed long after; though Mohammed might, from his discourse, gain some knowledge of Christianity and of the scriptures, which might be of use to him therein.<br \/> From the answer given in this passage of the Korân to the objection of the infidels, viz., that the person suspected by them to have a hand in the Korân spoke a foreign language, and therefore could not, with any face of probability, be supposed to assist in a composition written in the Arabic tongue, and with so great elegance, it is plain this person was no Arabian.  The word Ajami, which is here used, signifies any foreign or barbarous language in general; but the Arabs applying it more particularly to the Persian, it has been thence concluded by some that Salmân was the person; however, if it be true that he came not to Mohammed till after the Hejra, either he could not be the man here intended, or else this verse must have been revealed at Medina, contrary to the common opinion.<br \/><br \/>3  Al Zamakhshari, Al Beidâwi, Yahya.<br \/>4  Al Zamakh., Al Beidâwi.

Nor did the Mohammedan religion want its martyrs, in the strict sense of the word; of which I will here give two instances, besides the above-mentioned.  One is that of Khobaib Ebn Ada, who being perfidiously sold to the Koreish, was by them put to death in a cruel manner, by mutilation, and cutting off his flesh piecemeal; and being asked, in the midst of his tortures, whether he did not wish Mohammed was in his place, answered I would not wish to be with my family, my substance, and my children, on condition that Mohammed was only to be pricked with a thorn.5  The other is that of a man who was put to death by Moseilama, on the following occasion.  That false prophet having taken two of Mohammed&#39;s followers, asked one of them, what he said of Mohammed? the man answered, That he was the apostle of God: And what sayest thou of me? added Moseilama; to which he replied, Thou also art the apostle of God; whereupon he was immediately dismissed in safety.  But the other, having returned the same answer to the former question, refused to give any to the last, though required to do it three several times, but pretended to be deaf, and was therefore slain.  It is related that Mohammed, when the story of these two men was told him, said, The first of them threw himself on God&#39;s mercy; but the latter professed the truth; and he shall find his account in it.6<br \/><br \/>3  Al Beidâwi, Al Zamakh., Yahya.<br \/>4  Al Beidâwi.<br \/>5  Ebn Shohnah.<br \/>6  Al Beidâwi.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Whoso, after he hath believed in God denieth him, if he were forced to it and if his heart remain steadfast in the faith, shall be guiltless:17 but whoso openeth his breast to infidelity&ndash;on such shall be wrath from God, and a severe punishment awaiteth them.","17 This is to be understood of the persecutions endured by the more humble and needy Muslims by their townspeople of Mecca."],["2087","73","109","16","This shall be their sentence, because they have loved the present life above that which is to come, and for that GOD directeth not the unbelieving people.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","This, because they have loved this present life beyond the next, and because God guideth not the unbelievers!","<br \/>"],["2088","73","110","16","These are they whose hearts, and hearing, and sight, GOD hath sealed up; and these are the negligent: there is no doubt but that in the next life they shall perish.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","These are they whose hearts and ears and eyes God hath sealed up: these are the careless ones: in the next world shall they perish beyond a doubt.","<br \/>"],["2089","73","111","16","Moreover thy LORD will be favorable unto those who have fled their country, after having suffered persecution,c and had been compelled to deny the faith by violence, and who have since fought in defence of the true religion, and have persevered with patience; verily unto these will thy LORD be gracious and merciful, after they shall have shown their sincerity.","c  As did Ammâr, who made one in both the flights.

In their return, when they were not far from Medina, the army removing by night, Ayesha, on the road, alighted from her camel, and stepped aside on a private occasion: but, on her return, perceiving she had dropped her necklace, which was of onyxes of Dhafâr, she went back to look for it; and in the meantime her attendants, taking it for granted, that she was got into her pavilion (or little tent surrounded with curtains, wherein women are carried in the east) set it again on the camel, and led it away.  When she came back to the road, and saw her camel was gone, she sat down there, expecting that when she was missed some would be sent back to fetch her; and in a little time she fell asleep.  Early in the morning, Safwân Ebn al Moattel, who had stayed behind to rest himself, coming by, and perceiving somebody asleep, went to see who it was and knew her to be Ayesha; upon which he waked her, by twice pronouncing with a low voice these words, We are God&#39;s, and unto him must we return.  Then Ayesha immediately covered herself with her veil; and Safwân set her on his own camel, and led her after the army, which they overtook by noon, as they were resting.<br \/> This accident had like to have ruined Ayesha, whose reputation was publicly called in question, as if she had been guilty of adultery with Safwân; and Mohammed himself knew not what to think, when he reflected on the circumstances of the affair, which were improved by some malicious people very much to Ayesha&#39;s dishonour; and notwithstanding his wife&#39;s protestations of her innocence, he could not get rid of his perplexity, nor stop the mouths of the censorious, till about a month after, when this passage was revealed, declaring the accusation to be unjust.1<br \/><br \/>1  Al Bokhari in Sonna, Al Beidâwi, Jallalo&#39;ddin, &amp;c.

To which Moses answered, that in such case he would suffer the same punishment; and thereupon Karûn produced a harlot, whom he had hired to swear that Moses had lain with her, and charged him publicly with it; but on Moses adjuring the woman to speak the truth, her resolution failed her, and she confessed that she was suborned by Karûn to accuse him wrongfully; that then God directed Moses, who had complained to him of this usage, to command the earth what he pleased, and it should obey him; whereupon he said, O earth swallow them up! and that immediately the earth opened under Karûn and his confederates, and swallowed them up, with his palace and all his riches.1  There goes a tradition, that as Karûn sank gradually into the ground, first to his knees, then to his waist, then to his neck, he cried out four several times, O Moses, have mercy on me! but that Moses continued to say, O earth, swallow them up, till at last he wholly disappeared; upon which GOD said to Moses, Thou hast no mercy on Karûn, though he asked pardon of thee four times; but I would have had compassion on him if he had asked pardon of me but once.2<br \/><br \/>1  Abulfeda, Jallalo&#39;ddin, al Beidâwi, &amp;c.<br \/>2  Al Beidâwi.

Some place the victory gained by the Persians in the fifth year before the Hejra, and their defeat by the Greeks in the second year after it, when the battle of Bedr was fought:1 others place the former in the third or fourth year before the Hejra, and the latter in the end of the sixth or beginning of the seventh year after it, when the expedition of al Hodeibiyah was undertaken.2<br \/> The date of the victory gained by the Greeks, in the first of these accounts, interferes with a story which the commentators tell, of a wager laid by Abu Becr with Obba Ebn Khalf, who turned this prophecy into ridicule.  Abu Becr at first laid ten young camels that the Persians should receive an overthrow within three years; but on his acquainting Mohammed with what he had done, that prophet told him that the word bed&#39;, made use of in this passage, signified no determinate number of years, but any number from three to nine (though some suppose the tenth year is included), and therefore advised him to prolong the time, and to raise the wager; which he accordingly proposed to Obba, and they agreed that the time assigned should be nine years, and the wager a hundred camels.  Before the time was elapsed, Obba died of a wound he had received at Ohod, in the third year of the Hejra;3 but the event afterwards showing that Abu Becr had won, he received the camels of Obba&#39;s heirs, and brought them in triumph to Mohammed.4<br \/> History informs us that the successes of Khosru Parviz, king of Persia, who carried on a terrible war against the Greek empire, to revenge the death of Maurice, his father-in-law, slain by Phocas, were very great, and continued in an uninterrupted course for two and twenty years.  Particularly in the year of Christ 615, about the beginning of the sixth year before the Hejra the Persians, having the preceding year conquered Syria, made themselves masters of Palestine, and took Jerusalem; which seems to be that signal advantage gained over the Greeks mentioned in this passage, as agreeing best with the terms here used, and most likely to alarm the Arabs by reason of their vicinity to the scene of action: and there was so little probability, at that time, of the Greeks being able to retrieve their losses, much less to distress the Persians, that in the following years the arms of the latter made still farther and more considerable progresses, and at length they laid siege to Constantinople itself.  But in the year 625, in which the fourth year of the Hejra began, about ten years after the taking of Jerusalem, the Greeks, when it was least expected, gained a remarkable victory over the Persians, and not only obliged them to quit the territories of the empire, by carrying the war into their own country, but drove them to the last extremity, and spoiled the capital city al Madâyen; Heraclius enjoying thenceforward a continued series of good fortune, to the deposition and death of Khosru.  For more exact information in these matters, and more nicely fixing the dates, either so as to correspond with or to overturn this pretended prophecy (neither of which is my business here), the reader may have recourse to the historians and chronologers.5<br \/><br \/>1  Jallalo&#39;ddin, &amp;c.<br \/>2  Al Zamakh., al Beidâwi.<br \/>3  See p. 272, note h.<br \/>4  Al Beidâwi, Jallalo&#39;ddin, &amp;c.<br \/>5  Vide etiam Asseman, Bibl.

According to the description they give of his person, he must have been deformed enough; for they say he was of a black complexion (whence some call him an Ethiopian), with thick lips and splay feet: but in return he received from GOD wisdom and eloquence in a great degree, which some pretend were given him in a vision, on his making choice of wisdom preferably to the gift of prophecy, either of which were offered him.  The generality of the Mohammedans, therefore, hold him to have been no prophet, but only a wise man.  As to his condition, they say he was a slave, but obtained his liberty on the following occasion: His master having one day given him a bitter melon to eat, he paid him such exact obedience as to eat it all; at which his master being surprised, asked him how he could eat so nauseous a fruit?  To which he replied, it was no wonder that he should for once accept a bitter fruit from the same hand from which he had received so many favours.3  The commentators mention several quick repartees of Lokmân, which, together with the circumstances above mentioned, agree so well with what Maximus Planudes has written of Esop, that from thence, and from the fables attributed to Lokmân by the orientals, the latter has been generally thought to have been no other than the Esop of the Greeks.  However, that be (for I think the matter will bear a dispute), I am of opinion that Planudes borrowed great part of his life of Esop from the traditions he met with in the east concerning Lokmân, concluding them to have been the same person, because they were both slaves, and supposed to be the writers of those fables which go under their respective names, and bear a great resemblance to one another; for it has long since been observed by learned men that the greater part of that monk&#39;s performance is an absurd romance, and supported by no evidence of the ancient writers.4<br \/><br \/>3  Al Zamakh, al Beidâwi, &amp;c.

The first was their manner of divorcing their wives, when they had no mind to let them go out of their house, or to marry again; and this the husband did by saying to the woman, Thou art henceforward to me as the back of my mother; after which words pronounced he abstained from her bed, and regarded her in all respects as his mother, and she became related to all his kindred in the same degree as if she had been really so.  The other custom was the holding their adopted sons to be as as nearly related to them as their natural sons, so that the same impediments of marriage arose from that supposed relation, in the prohibited degrees, as it would have done in the case of a genuine son.  The latter Mohammed had a peculiar reason to abolish&ndash;viz., his marrying the divorced wife of his freedman Zeid, who was also his adopted son, of which more will be said by-and-bye.  By the declaration which introduces this passage, that GOD has not given a man two hearts, is meant, that a man cannot have the same affection for supposed parents and adopted children, as for those who are really so.  They tell us the Arabs used to say, of a prudent and acute person, that he had two hearts; whence one Abu Mámer, or, as others write, Jemîl Ebn Asad al Fihri, was surnamed Dhu&#39;lkalbein, or the man with two hearts.3<br \/><br \/>3  Idem, Jallalo&#39;ddin, &amp;c.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made your wives whom ye divorce2 to be as your mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons to be as your own sons.

This Zeinab failed not to acquaint her husband with on his return home; whereupon, Zeid, after mature reflection, thought he could do no less than part with his wife in favour of his benefactor, and therefore resolved to divorce her, and acquainted Mohammed with his resolution; but he, apprehending the scandal it might raise, offered to dissuade him from it, and endeavoured to stifle the flames which inwardly consumed him; but at length, his love for her being authorized by this revelation, he acquiesced, and after the term of her divorce was expired, married her in the latter end of the fifth year of the Hejra.3<br \/><br \/>3  Al Beidâwi, al Jannabi, &amp;c.<br \/><br \/>m  It is observed that this is the only person, of all Mohammed&#39;s companions, whose name is mentioned in the Korân.<br \/><br \/>n  Whence Zeinab used to vaunt herself above the prophet&#39;s other wives, saying that GOD had made the match between Mohammed and herself, whereas their matches were made by their relations.4<br \/><br \/>4  Idem.<br \/><br \/>o  For this feigned relation, as has been observed, created an impediment of marriage among the old Arabs within the prohibited degrees, in the same manner as if it had been real; and therefore Mohammed&#39;s marrying Zeinab, who had been his adopted son&#39;s wife, occasioned great scandal among his followers, which was much heightened by the Jews and hypocrites: but the custom is here declared unreasonable, and abolished for the future.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God had shewn favour,17 and to whom thou also hadst shewn favour, &quot;Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;&quot; and thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light.18 and thou didst fear man; but more right had it been to fear God. And when Zaid had settled concerning her to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have settled the affair concerning them. And the behest of God is to be performed.","17 That is, to Zaid. The favour of God to Zaid consisted in having caused him to become a Muslim: the favour of Muhammad in adopting him as his son.

Habîb was convinced by this miracle, and believed; after which they went into the city and preached the worship of one true GOD, curing a great number of people of several infirmities; but at length, the affair coming to the prince&#39;s ear, he ordered them to be imprisoned for endeavouring to seduce the people.  When Jesus heard of this, he sent another of his disciples, generally supposed to have been Simon Peter, who, coming to Antioch, and appearing as a zealous idolater, soon insinuated himself into the favour of the inhabitants and of their prince, and at length took an opportunity to desire the prince would order the two persons who, as he was informed, had been put in prison for broaching new opinions, to be brought before him to be examined; and accordingly they were brought: when Peter, having previously warned them to take no notice that they knew him, asked them who sent them, to which they answered, GOD, who had created all things, and had no companion.  He then required some convincing proof of their mission, upon which they restored a blind person to his sight and performed some other miracles, with which Peter seemed not to be satisfied, for that, according to some, he did the very same miracles himself, but declared that, if their GOD could enable them to raise the dead, he would believe them; which condition the two apostles accepting, a lad was brought who had been dead seven days, and at their prayers he was raised to life; and thereupon Peter acknowledged himself convinced, and ran and demolished the idols, a great many of the people following him, and embracing the true faith; but those who believed not were destroyed by the cry of the angel Gabriel.1<br \/><br \/>1  Al Zamakh., al Beidâwi, &amp;c.

They also allege the testimony of their prophet, who is reported to have said, I am the son of the two who were offered in sacrifice; meaning his great ancestor, Ismael, and his own father Abd&#39;allah: for Abd&#39;almotalleb had made a vow that if GOD would permit him to find out and open the well Zemzem, and should give him ten sons, he would sacrifice one of them.  Accordingly, when he had obtained his desire in both respects, he cast lots on his sons, and the lot falling on Abd&#39;allah, he redeemed him by offering a hundred camels, which was therefore ordered to be the price of a man&#39;s blood in the Sonna.1<br \/><br \/>1  Idem, Jallalo&#39;ddin, al Zamakh.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","His father said to him, &quot;My son, I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee; therefore, consider what thou seest right.&quot;","<br \/>"],["4075","50","102","37","He answered, O my father, do what thou art commanded: thou shalt find me, if GOD please, a patient person.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","He said, &quot;My father, do what thou art bidden; of the patient, if God please, shalt thou find me.&quot;","<br \/>"],["4076","50","103","37","And when they had submitted themselves to the divine will, and Abraham had laid his son prostrate on his face,x","x  The commentators add, that Abraham went so far as to draw the knife with all his strength across the lad&#39;s throat, but was miraculously hindered from hurting him.2<br \/><br \/>2  Idem, Jallalo&#39;ddin.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","And when they had surrendered them to the will of God, he laid him down upon his forehead:","<br \/>"],["4077","50","104","37","we cried unto him, O Abraham,","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","We cried unto him, &quot;O Abraham!","<br \/>"],["4078","50","105","37","now hast thou verified the vision.

At length Solomon being informed of this idolatry, which was practised under his roof, by his vizir Asâf, he broke the image, and having chastised the woman, went out into the desert, where he wept and made supplications to GOD; who did not think fit, however, to let his negligence pass without some correction.  It was Solomon&#39;s custom, while he eased or washed himself, to entrust his signet, on which his kingdom depended, with a concubine of his named Amîna: one day, therefore, when she had the ring in her custody, a devil, named Sakhar, came to her in the shape of Solomon, and received the ring from her; by virtue of which he became possessed of the kingdom, and sat on the throne in the shape which he had borrowed, making what alterations in the law he pleased.  Solomon, in the meantime, being changed in his outward appearance, and known to none of his subjects, was obliged to wander about, and beg alms for his subsistence; till at length, after the space of forty days, which was the time the image had been worshipped in his house, the devil flew away, and threw the signet into the sea: the signet was immediately swallowed by a fish, which being taken and given to Solomon, he found the ring in its belly, and having by this means recovered the kingdom, took Sakhar, and tying a great stone to his neck, threw him into the lake of Tiberias.2<br \/><br \/>1  Vide Talm.

Mohammed having lain with a slave of his named Mary, of Coptic extract (who had been sent him as a present by al Mokawkas, governor of Eygpt), on the day which was due to Ayesha, or to Hafsa, and, as some say, on Hafsa&#39;s own bed, while she was absent; and this coming to Hafsa&#39;s knowledge, she took it extremely ill, and reproached her husband so sharply that, to pacify her, he promised, with an oath, never to touch the maid again:1 and to free him from the obligation of this promise was the design of the chapter.<br \/> I cannot here avoid observing, as a learned writer2 has done before me, that Dr. Prideaux has strangely misrepresented this passage.  For having given the story of the prophet&#39;s amour with his maid mary, a little embellished, he proceeds to tell us that in this chapter Mohammed brings in GOD allowing him, and all his Moslems, to lie with their maids when they will, notwithstanding their wives (whereas the words relate to the prophet only, who wanted not any new permission for that purpose, because it was a privilege already granted him,3 though to none else); and then, to show what ground he had for his assertion, adds that the first words of the chapter are, O prophet, why dost thou forbid what GOD hath allowed thee, that thou mayest please thy wives?  GOD hath granted unto you to lie with your maid-servants.4  Which last words are not to be found here, or elsewhere in the Korân, and contain an allowance of what is expressly forbidden therein;5 though the doctor has thence taken occasion to make some reflections which might as well have been spared.  I shall say nothing to aggravate the matter, but leave the reader to imagine what this reverend divine would have said of a Mohammedan if he had caught him tripping in the like manner.<br \/> Having digressed so far, I will venture to add a word or two in order to account for one circumstance which Dr. Prideaux relates concerning Mohammed&#39;s concubine Mary; viz., that after her master&#39;s death, no account was had of her or the son which she had borne him, but both were sent away into Egypt, and no mention made of either ever after among them; and then he supposes (for he seldom is at a loss for a supposition) that Ayesha, out of the hatred which she bore her, procured of her father, who succeeded the impostor in the government, to have her thus disposed of.6  But it being certain, by the general consent of all the eastern writers, that Mary continued in Arabia till her death, which happened at Medina about five years after that of her master, and was buried in the usual burying-place there, called al Bakí, and that her son died before his father, it has been asked, whence the doctor had this?7  I answer, that I guess he had it partly from Abulfaragius, according to the printed edition of whose work, the Mary we are speaking of is said to have been sent with her sister Shirin (not with her son) to Alexandria by al Mokawkas;8 though I make no doubt but we ought in that passage to read min, from, instead if ila, to (notwithstanding the manuscript copies of this author used by Dr. Pocock, the editor, and also a very fair one in my own possession, agree in the latter reading); and that the sentence ought to run thus, quam (viz., Mariam) unà cum sorore Shirina ab Alexandria miserat al Mokawkas.<br \/><br \/>1  Al Zamakh., al Beidâwi.<br \/>1  Idem, Jallal., Yahya.<br \/>2  Gagnier, not. ad Abulf.

Hafsa, however, could not conceal this from Ayesha, with whom she lived in strict friendship, but acquainted her with the whole matter: whereupon the prophet, perceiving, probably by Ayesha&#39;s behaviour, that his secret had been discovered, upbraided Hafsa with her betraying him, telling her that GOD had revealed it to him; and not only divorced her, but separated him from all his other wives for a whole month, which time he spent in the apartment of Mary.  In a short time, notwithstanding, he took Hafsa again, by the direction, as he gave out, of the angel Gabriel, who commended her for her frequent fasting and other exercises of devotion, assuring him likewise that she should be one of his wives in paradise.11<br \/><br \/>11  Idem. al Zamakh, &amp;c.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","When the prophet told a recent occurrence as a secret to one of his wives, and when she divulged it and God informed him of this, he acquainted her with part and withheld part.2 And when he had told her of it, she said, &quot;Who told thee this?&quot; He said, &quot;The Knowing, the Sage hath told it me.","2 Muhammad withheld the fact that Ayesha, as well as God, was his informant, but taxed Hafsa with not having kept his secret."],["5564","109","4","66","If ye both be turned unto GOD (for your hearts have swerved) it is well: but if ye join against him, verily GOD is his patron; and Gabriel, and the good man among the faithful, and the angels also are his assistants.l","l  This sentence is directed to Hafsa and Ayesha; the pronouns and verbs of the second person being in the dual number.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","&quot;If ye both be turned to God in penitence, for now have your hearts gone astray . . . .3 but if ye conspire against the Prophet, then know that God is his Protector, and Gabriel, and every just man among the faithful; and the angels are his helpers besides.","<br \/>"],["5565","109","5","66","If he divorce you, his LORD can easily give him in exchange other wives better than you, women resigned unto God, true believers, devout, penitent, obedient, given to fasting, both such as have been known by other men, and virgins.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","&quot;Haply if he put you both away, his Lord will give him in exchange other wives better than you, Muslims, believers, devout, penitent, obedient, observant of fasting, both known of men and virgins.&quot;","<br \/>"],["5566","109","6","66","O true believers, save your souls, and those of your families, from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and terrible;m who disobey not GOD in what he hath commanded them, but perform what they are commanded.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","O Believers! save yourselves and your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and mighty: they disobey not God in what He hath commanded them, but execute His behests.","<br \/>"],["5567","109","7","66","O unbelievers, excuse not yourselves this day; ye shall surely be rewarded for what ye have done.n","n  These words will be spoken to the infidels at the last day.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","O ye Infidels! make no excuses for yourselves this day; ye shall surely be recompensed according to your works.","<br \/>"],["5568","109","8","66","O true believers, turn unto GOD with a sincere repentance: peradventure your LORD will do away from you your evil deeds, and will admit you into gardens, through which rivers flow; on the day whereon GOD will not put to shame the prophet, or those who believe with him: their light shall run before them, and on their right hands,o and they shall say, LORD, make our light perfect, and forgive us: for thou art almighty.","o  See chapter 57, p. 400.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","O Believers! turn to God with the turning of true penitence; haply your Lord will cancel your evil deeds, and will bring you into the gardens 'neath which the rivers flow, on the day when God will not shame the Prophet, nor those who have shared his faith: their light shall run before them, and on their right hands! they shall say, &quot;Lord perfect our light, and pardon us: for thou hast power over all things.&quot;","<br \/>"],["5569","109","9","66","O prophet, attack the infidels with arms, and the hypocrites with arguments; and treat them with severity: their abode shall be hell, and an ill journey shall it be thither.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them.

Possibly the letters Ha, Mim, which are prefixed to numerous successive Suras were private marks, or initial letters, attached by their proprietor to the copies furnished to Said when effecting his recension of the text under Othman. In the same way, the letters prefixed to other Suras may be monograms, or abbreviations, or initial letters of the names of the persons to whom the copies of the respective Suras belonged.<br \/><br \/>addendum: The symbol nun may possibly refer to this letter as forming the Rhyme in most of the verses of this Sura.<br \/><br \/>2 This Sura has been supposed by ancient Muslim authorities to be, if not the oldest, the second revelation, and to have followed Sura xcvi.

The words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar to the Meccans, especially to that numerous body who were anxiously searching after some better religion than the idolatries of their fathers (v. on Sura iii. 19, 60), and provided Muhammad with a copious fund from which to draw."],["5863","2","0","74","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>"],["5864","2","0","74","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>"],["5865","2","0","74","CHAPTER LXXIV","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","SURA LXXIV.&ndash;THE ENWRAPPED1 [II.]","1 This Sura is placed by Muir in the &#34;second stage&#34; of Meccan Suras, and twenty-first in chronological order, in the third or fourth year of the Prophet&#39;s career.  According, however, to the chronological list of Suras given by Weil (Leben M. p. 364) from ancient tradition, as well as from the consentient voice of tradionists and commentaries (v. Nöld. Geschichte, p. 69; Sprenger&#39;s Life of Mohammad, p. 111) it was the next revealed after the Fatrah, and the designation to the prophetic office.  The main features of the tradition are, that Muhammad while wandering about in the hills near Mecca, distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth, had a vision of the Angel Gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth, that he ran to his wife, Chadijah, in the greatest alarm, and desired her, perhaps from superstitious motives (and believing that if covered with clothes he should be shielded from the glances of evil spirits&ndash;comp. Stanley on I Cor. xi. 10), to envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him as in v. I.  This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi., may actually have occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from which Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered.  Hence Muhammad in Sura lxxxi. appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe it to be.  It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions may be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there is an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the bottom a residuum of fact and historical truth.  At the same time there can be no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly founded upon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of the Koran, and are pure inventions of a later age."],["5866","2","0","74","ENTITLED, THE COVERED; REVEALED AT MECCA.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","MECCA.&ndash;55 Verses","<br \/>"],["5867","2","0","74","IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful","<br \/>"],["5868","2","1","74","O THOU covered,q","q  It is related, from Mohammed&#39;s own mouth, that being on Mount Harâ, and hearing himself called, he looked on each hand, and saw nobody; but looking upwards, he saw the angel Gabriel on a throne, between heaven and earth; at which sight being much terrified, he returned to his wife Khadîjah, and bade her cover him up; and that then the angel descended, and addressed him in the words of the text.  From hence some think this chapter to have been the first which was revealed: but the more received opinion is, that it was the 96th.

This vow was performed with so great strictness, that the first day, having no provisions in the house, Ali was obliged to borrow three measures of barley of one Simeon, a Jew, of Khaibar, one measure of which Fâtema ground the same day, and baked five cakes of the meal, and they were set before them to break their fast with after sunset: but a poor man coming to them, they gave all their bread to him, and passed the night without tasting anything except water.  The next day Fâtema made another measure into bread, for the same purpose; but an orphan begging some food, they chose to let him have it, and passed that night as the first; and the third day they likewise gave their whole provision to a famished captive.

It was in the first instance taught to the Koreisch by Omayah of Taief, the poet, who was a contemporary with, but somewhat older than, Muhammad; and who, during his mercantile journeys into Arabia Petr&#39;a and Syria, had made himself acquainted with the sacred books and doctrines of Jews and Christians. (Kitab al-Aghâni, 16. Delhi.) Muhammad adopted and constantly used it, and it is prefixed to each Sura except the ninth. The former of the two epithets implies that the mercy of God is exercised as occasions arise, towards all his creatures; the latter that the quality of mercy is inherent in God and permanent, so that there is only a shade of difference between the two words. Maracci well renders, In Nomine Dei Miseratoris, Misericordis. The rendering I have adopted is that of Mr. Lane in his extracts from the Koran. See also Freytag's Lex. ii. p. 133. Perhaps, In the name of Allah, the God of Mercy, the Merciful, would more fully express the original Arabic. The first five verses of this Sura are, in the opinion of nearly all commentators, ancient and modern, the earliest revelations made to Muhammad, in the 40th year of his life, and the starting point of El-Islam.

But the word qaraa, which is the root of the word Koran, analogous to the Rabbinic mikra, rather means to address, recite; and with regard to its etymology and use in the kindred dialects to call, cry aloud, proclaim.

I understand this passage to mean, &quot;Preach to thy fellow men what thou believest to be true of thy Lord who has created man from the meanest materials, and can in like manner prosper the truth which thou proclaimest. He has taught man the art of writing (recently introduced at Mecca) and in this thou wilt find a powerful help for propagating the knowledge of the divine Unity.&quot; The speaker in this, as in all the Suras, is Gabriel, of whom Muhammad had, as he believed, a vision on the mountain Hirâ, near Mecca.

Many of them suffered torture for their faith in him, and two of them died as martyrs.

This interval is called the Fatrah or intermission; and the Meccan Suras delivered at its close show that at or during this period Muhammad had gained an increasing and more intimate acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. &quot;The accounts, however,&quot; says Mr. Muir (vol. ii. 86) &quot;are throughout confused, if not contradictory; and we can only gather with certainty that there was a time during which his mind hung in suspense, and doubted the divine mission.&quot; The idea of any supernatural influence is of course to be entirely excluded; although there is no doubt that Muhammad himself had a full belief in the personality and influence of Satans and Djinn. Profound meditation, the struggles of an earnest mind anxious to attain to truth, the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject, visions seen in epileptic swoons, disgust at Meccan idolatry, and a desire to teach his countrymen the divine Unity will sufficiently account for the period of indecision termed the Fatrah, and for the determination which led Muhammad, in all sincerity, but still self-deceived, to take upon himself the office and work of a Messenger from God. We may perhaps infer from such passages as Sura ii. 123, what had ever been the leading idea in Muhammad's mind."],["6608","21","0","97","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>"],["6609","21","0","97","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>"],["6610","21","0","97","CHAPTER XCVII.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","SURA XCVII.&ndash;POWER [XXI.]","<br \/>"],["6611","21","0","97","ENTITLED, AL KADR; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","97:all<br \/><i>The Dawn-Breakers<\/i>, Chapter VI, p. 126<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/bahai-library.com\/books\/dawnbreakers\/chapters\/6.html#126\" target=\"_top\">link<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/bahai-library.com\/books\/dawnbreakers\/footnotes\/6\/126-2.html\" target=\"_top\">link<\/a>","MECCA.&ndash;5 Verses","<br \/>"],["6612","21","0","97","IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful","<br \/>"],["6613","21","1","97","VERILY we sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr.s","s  The word al Kadr signifies power and honor or dignity, and also the divine decree; and the night is so named either from its excellence above all other nights in the year, or because, as the Mohammedans believe, the divine decrees for the ensuing year are annually on this night fixed and settled, or taken from the preserved table by GOD&#39;S throne, and given to the angels to be executed.1  On this night Mohammed received his first revelations; when the Korân, say the commentators, was sent down from the aforesaid table, entire and in one volume, to the lowest heaven, from whence Gabriel revealed it to Mohammed by parcels, as occasion required.<br \/> The Moslem doctors are not agreed where to fix the night of al Kadr; the greater part are of opinion that it is one of the ten last nights of Ramadân, and, as is commonly believed, the seventh of those nights, reckoning backward; by which means it will fall between the 23rd and 24th days of that month.2<br \/><br \/>1  See cap. 44, p. 367.<br \/>2  Al Zamakh., al Beidâwi, Jallalo&#39;ddin.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","VERILY, we have caused It1 to descend on the night of POWER.","1 The Koran, which is now pressed on the Meccans with increased prominence, as will be seen in many succeeding Suras of this period."],["6614","21","2","97","And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr is?","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","And who shall teach thee what the night of power is?","<br \/>"],["6615","21","3","97","The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months.","<br \/>","<br \/>","Shoghi Effendi in <i>The Dawn-Breakers<\/i>: excelleth a thousand months","<i>The Dawn-Breakers<\/i>, Chapter VI, p. 126<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/bahai-library.com\/books\/dawnbreakers\/chapters\/6.html#126\" target=\"_top\">link<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/bahai-library.com\/books\/dawnbreakers\/footnotes\/6\/126-2.html\" target=\"_top\">link<\/a>","The night of power excelleth a thousand months:","<br \/>"],["6616","21","4","97","Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit of Gabriel also, by the permission of their LORD, with his decrees concerning every matter.t","t  See the preceding note, and chapter 44, p. 367.","<br \/>","<br \/>","<br \/>","Therein descend the angels and the spirit by permission of their Lord for every matter;2","2 The night of Al Kadr is one of the last ten nights of Ramadhan, and as is commonly believed the seventh of those nights reckoning backward.

At this profanation Abraha being highly incensed, vowed the destruction of the Caaba, and accordingly set out against Mecca at the head of a considerable army, wherein were several elephants, which he had obtained of the king of Ethiopia, their numbers being, as some say, thirteen, though others mention but one.  The Meccans, at the approach of so considerable a host, retired to the neighbouring mountains, being unable to defend their city or temple; but GOD himself undertook the protection of both.  For when Abraha drew near to Mecca, and would have entered it, the elephant on which he rode, which was a very large one, and named Mahmûd, refused to advance any nigher to the town, but knelt down whenever they endeavoured to force him that way, though he would rise and march briskly enough if they turned him towards any other quarter: and while matters were in this posture, on a sudden a large flock of birds, like swallows, came flying from the sea coast, every one of which carried three stones, one in each foot, and one in its bill; and these stones they threw down upon the heads of Abraha&#39;s men, certainly killing every one they struck.  Then GOD sent a flood, which swept the dead bodies, and some of those who had not been struck by the stones, into the sea: the rest fled toward Yaman, but perished by the way; none of them reaching Sanaa, except only Abraha himself, who died soon after his arrival there, being struck with a sort of plague or putrefaction, so that his body opened, and his limbs rotted off by piecemeal.  It is said that one of Abraha&#39;s army, named Abu Yacsûm, escaped over the Red Sea into Ethiopia, and going directly to the king, told him the tragical story; and upon that prince&#39;s asking him what sort of birds they were that had occasioned such a destruction, the man pointed to one of them, which had followed him all the way, and was at that time hovering directly over his head, when immediately the bird let fall the stone, and struck him dead at the king&#39;s feet.5<br \/> This remarkable defeat of Abraha happened the very year Mohammed was born, and as this chapter was revealed before the Hejra, and within fifty-four years, at least, after it came to pass, when several persons who could have detected the lie, had Mohammed forged this story out of his own head, were alive, it seems as if there was really something extraordinary in the matter, which might, by adding some circumstances, have been worked up into a miracle to his hands.  Marracci6 judges the whole to be either a fable, or else a feat of some evil spirits, of which he gives a parallel instance, as he thinks, in the strange defeat of Brennus, when he was marching to attack the temple of Apollo at Delphi.7  Dr. Prideaux directly charges Mohammed with coining this miracle, notwithstanding he might have been so easily disproved, and supposes, without any foundation, that this chapter might not have been published till Othman&#39;s edition of the Korân,1 which was many years after, when all might be dead who could remember anything of the above-mentioned war.2  But Mohammed had no occasion to coin such a miracle himself, to gain the temple of Mecca any greater veneration: the Meccans were but too superstitiously fond of it, and obliged him, against his inclinations and original design, to make it the chief place of his new invented worship.  I cannot, however, but observe Dr. Prideaux&#39;s partiality on this occasion, compared with the favourable reception he gives to the story of the miraculous overthrow of Brennus and his army, which he concludes in the following words: &#34;Thus was GOD pleased in a very extraordinary manner to execute his vengeance upon those sacrilegious wretches for the sake of religion in general, how false and idolatrous soever that particular religion was, for which that temple at Delphos was erected.&#34;3  If it be answered, that the Gauls believed the religion, to the devotions of which that temple was consecrated, to be true (though that be not certain), and therefore it was an impiety in them to offer violence to it, whereas Abraha acknowledged not the holiness of the Caaba, or the worship there practised; I reply, that the doctor, on occasion of Cambyses being killed by a wound he accidentally received in the same part of the body where he had before mortally wounded the Apis, or bull worshipped by the Egyptians, whose religion and worship that prince most certainly believed to be false and superstitious, makes the same reflection: &#34;The Egyptians,&#34; says he, &#34;reckoned this as an especial judgment from heaven upon him for that fact, and perchance they were not much out in it: for it seldom happening in an affront given to any mode of worship, how erroneous soever it may be, but that religion is in general wounded hereby, there are many instances in history, wherein GOD hath very signally punished the profanations of religion in the worst of times, and under the worst modes of heathen idolatry.&#34;4<br \/><br \/>4  See the Prelim.

This army was cut off by small-pox (Wakidi; Hishami), and there is no doubt, as the Arabic word for small-pox also means &quot;small stones,&quot; in reference to the hard gravelly feeling of the pustules, what is the true interpretation of the fourth line of this Sura, which, like many other poetical passages in the Koran, has formed the starting point for the most puerile and extravagant legends.
