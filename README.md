Due to changes in PHP, the code is no longer working and needs a rewrite.

However, I have begun to rewrite in client-side JavaScript so that
it can work offline.

# Text Browser

This software currently allows one (through use of PHP and MySQL) to have multilinear texts (represented in SQL tables that you must yourself upload, though it is hoped that for our main version of this project--which is a Baha'i project--the addition of these tables (which are Scriptures) can also be automated) automatically be accessible from a main interface, with each text being given its own customizable interface to allow browsing of the contents of the text. Presently there is a large amount of manual customization required to make it work, but it is hoped that this problem can be overcome in the future.

If you would be willing to participate in the development of this software, please email brettz9@yahoo.com and/or visit http://bahai-library.com/browser for the latest code.
